	Long: `Agents are compromised machines that have an established callback to the C2 server. Use the various agents commands to interact with your agents, and run commands. 
	You are in charge of your "houses" in your city of medellin!

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// launcherCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// launcherCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
